# Timezone Converter API

## Description:
This is an API created for my CS361 group assignment on the Microservice architecture. This program creates an HTTP server and listens to requests about converting timezone data. The server handles errors related to improper timezones and invalid json format. 

An example usage of this API can be found in example.py which uses the requests package to send an http request to convert EST to PST.

## Installation:
The server requires at least Go version v1.22.1. To download Go visit https://go.dev/doc/install

- Clone the git repository via `git clone https://github.com/Clavvv/CS361_Timezone_API.git`
- run `cd CS361_Timezone_API` to enter the project directory
- Start the server by running `go run main.go`
